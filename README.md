#Reverse ATS

The goal of this project is to practice web-scraping with Python through a project that aims to streamline the job application process. The inspiration for this project comes from the Applicant Tracking System (ATS), a type of software used by many companies to organize and filter out prospective job candidates. 

According to a [study at Mercy College](https://career.mercy.edu/blog/2019/11/08/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20a%20well%20organized,impression%20you%20make%20is%20critical.), a recruiter spends 7 seconds looking at a resume; and that is if it makes it past the ATS. By web-scraping job descriptions on LinkedIn, Indeed, and other online job boards, I aim to compare the hard-skills and qualities specified on the job posting, to a resume in order to determine how closely they align. For web-scraping I plan to use the popular Beautiful Soup Python library. I have yet to determine how I will dissect the raw data, but it is safe to assume that I will use some form of Natural Language Processing to identify qualities/skills and to compare the scraped results with a resume. 

If the project proves to be a feasible and useful product, I will try and release it as a useable service (i.e) Chrome Extension, so people are able to identify which jobs they would be most qualified for, or how they could possibly improve their resume.
